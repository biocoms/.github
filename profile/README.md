# BioComs Lab
**Biostatistics and Computational Biology Laboratory**  
**University of Iowa, USA**

Welcome to the GitHub page for the **BioComs Lab**! We are a research group dedicated to advancing the fields of biostatistics and computational biology through innovative analysis, modeling, and interpretation of complex biological data. Our lab specializes in integrative and computational approaches to address scientific questions in health and disease, with a particular focus on microbiome research, epigenetics, and multi-omics data integration.

## Research Areas

### Oral Microbiome
We investigate the composition, functional profile, and variability of the oral microbiome. Our team applies **taxonomic and functional profiling** methods combined with **statistical analysis** to understand how the oral microbiome influences health outcomes and disease progression.
### Epigenetics and Methylation Analysis
Our work explores **DNA methylation** and other epigenetic modifications to elucidate their roles in gene regulation and disease. We integrate methylation data with other omics data to uncover biological insights into complex diseases.

### Multi-Omics Integration
The lab focuses on integrating diverse types of omics data, including genomics, transcriptomics, methylomics, proteomics, and metabolomics, to provide a comprehensive view of biological systems. One group of students work on meta-omics integrations.

### Machine Learning and Statistical Modeling
We utilize **machine learning** and **advanced statistical modeling** to analyze high-dimensional datasets. Our approaches include feature selection, predictive modeling, and data-driven hypothesis testing.

## Get Involved
Our lab is collaborative, and we are always looking for potential collaborators and interested students. If you are passionate about computational biology, biostatistics, or machine learning applications in health, we would love to connect!
